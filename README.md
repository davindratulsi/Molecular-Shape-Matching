# Molecular-Shape-Matching
Implementation of a Molecule class from xyz or cus trajectories

An instance of the Molecule class can access various coordinate transformation methods (scaling, translation and rotation). Example applications include:
- Molecular Shape Matching via Voxel matching
- Generation of ordered configurations for single/multiple collections of molecules
